        Cai's album,{" "}
        <b>
          <i>And in the Darkness, Hearts Aglow by Weyes Blood</i>
        </b>
        , is the second in a trilogy of albums. The first in the trilogy centers
        around the theme of impending doom, so And in the Darkness, Hearts
        Aglow, naturally, is about feeling around in the darkness for meaning,
        specifically in a period of instability and change (topical, no?).
        Stylistically, this album is similar to Lana del Rey, "but with actual
        energy". Perfect for seasonal depression, this album captures emotions
        with "whatever words capture them". Standout tracks include{" "}
        <b>Hearts Aglow</b> and <b>God Turn Me Into a Flower</b>.

        AJ's album,{" "}
        <i>
          <b>Stankonia by OutKast</b>
        </i>
        , is a chaotic, adventurous, funny album. Though it is a hip-hop album,
        it's obvious that OutKast didn't listen to hip-hop while recording
        Stankonia. Instead, the duo listened to mostly Chuck Berry, Jimi
        Hendrix, and Prince, and the rock influence shows, in the best way. The
        album also draws from electronic, funk, and more, overall giving the
        album an "otherworldly" quality. The storytelling throughout the album
        also stands out, particularly on <b>Question Mark</b> and{" "}
        <b>Toilet Tissue</b>. Classics like <b>Ms Jackson</b> and{" "}
        <b>So Far, So Clean</b> also come from Stankonia.

        Daniel's song,{" "}
        <b>
          <i>How to Disappear Completely by Radiohead</i>
        </b>
        , is, like <i>And in the Darkness, Hearts Aglow</i>, perfect for
        seasonal depression. If you're looking to cry in the dark on the floor,
        this might just be your new soundtrack. In the song, Thom Yorke sings
        about dissociation, depression, and being completely overwhelmed and
        overstressed. The song begins with a single dissonant tone, and over
        time builds into a powerfully pleading climax of strings, vocals, and
        electronic elements all combined.

        My song,{" "}
        <i>
          <b>I Sat by the Ocean by Queens of the Stone Age</b>
        </i>
        , takes lyrics about a tough breakup and lays them over grooving bass
        and guitar riffs to make a good, simple rock song. Clean guitar slides
        support the singer's falsetto as he laments what he has lost, producing
        a satisfying, easy-to-listen-to track with just the right amount of
        substance.
