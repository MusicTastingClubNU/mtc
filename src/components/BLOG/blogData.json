    "blogContent": "If you‚Äôre a fan of Wu-Tang, Nas, or MF DOOM, Joey Bada$$‚Äôs '1999' is an album you should listen to. It‚Äôs a great 90s New York Hip Hop album with accessible beats and slick flows for an overall enjoyable listen. As a 21 year old New Yorker, it somehow makes me nostalgic for a time I wasn‚Äôt even around for. Favorite three songs of the album are: ‚ÄòWorld Domination‚Äô, ‚ÄòPennyroyal‚Äô, and ‚ÄòRighteous Minds‚Äô.",

It was described by<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>as \"alien sci-fi bar music\", and reminiscent of Knights of Sidonia by Muse and the boomerang channel theme song. Its non-English lyrics gathered mixed reviews.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Simon's album,&nbsp;<i><b>The Well I Fell Into by WHY?</b></i>, is an indie rock album in which the singer processes a recent breakup. It's also topical for the Jewish high holidays (shana tovah and hope everyone who observes had an easy fast), featuring verbal references to rosh hashanah as well as instrumentals from a shofar!<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">Members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>particularly enjoyed songs like \"Marigold\" and \"Versa Go!\", but many took issue with the fifth track, \"When We Do The Dance\". Specifically, the lyric \"I wanna bust in your great great grandmother's uterus\" proved controversial. I thought it was a banger.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Aidan's song(s),&nbsp;<i><b>De Selby Pts 1 and 2 by Hozier</b></i>, could be classified as minor cheating of song of the week, but, for Hozier's layered vocals, expert lyricism, and darkly lilting instrumentals, exceptions can be made. Many club<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>were previously familiar with either Hozier or De Selby but enjoyed the opportunity to relisten to it. Preferences were split between parts 1 and 2.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Joseph's song,<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Something Holy - Live at Funkhaus, 2019 by Alice Phoebe Lou</b><i>,&nbsp;</i>is an indie pop song about female sexuality. Specifically, though, Joseph chose the live version, which highlights Lou's exceptional vocals -- Bjorklike and filled with emotion. It's hard to believe this song was recorded live.<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">Members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>thought the instrumentals did not fall short of the pole vault bar set by Lou's vocals though. A strong bassline and dreamy guitars completed this song.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also,<span>&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#0000ff\"><b><span class=\"il\">MTC</span><span>&nbsp;</span>discovered Wordle-like music games</b>,<span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color=\"#000000\">like the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://spotle.io/__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!XW5vX7iWsEkOg9Tm2xxPTOpU92mPU_OGv6FqN9nmMuRKUGrspfYG9x1gZqcdFyZVgALNwIZj3L7IIhm95MFLRrsB2rIsNsmdSMOqHTjNMZIc0hMxwlz7DH0$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://spotle.io/__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!XW5vX7iWsEkOg9Tm2xxPTOpU92mPU_OGv6FqN9nmMuRKUGrspfYG9x1gZqcdFyZVgALNwIZj3L7IIhm95MFLRrsB2rIsNsmdSMOqHTjNMZIc0hMxwlz7DH0$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1735340363760000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2joUuHn-1Ry0aCnvrp0VJo\">spotle</a>&nbsp;(we hit a 1 for 3 out of the games we played&nbsp;üò¨) (we had fun and that's what matters).</font></div><div><br></div><div>That's all from me today!</div><div><br></div><div>Hope to see you at&nbsp;<b>5pm&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">in</font><b>&nbsp;Kresge 2420&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">on</font><b>&nbsp;Thursday 10/17</b>&nbsp;ready for discussion of this week's&nbsp;picks as well as your favorite music videos!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><span class=\"gmail_signature_prefix\">--</span><br><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_signature\" data-smartmail=\"gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><b><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"arial black, sans-serif\">Corey Dubin</font></b><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">Print Media Chair |&nbsp;</font><span>Music Tasting Club</span></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!XW5vX7iWsEkOg9Tm2xxPTOpU92mPU_OGv6FqN9nmMuRKUGrspfYG9x1gZqcdFyZVgALNwIZj3L7IIhm95MFLRrsB2rIsNsmdSMOqHTjNMZIc0hMxVHwQXC8$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!XW5vX7iWsEkOg9Tm2xxPTOpU92mPU_OGv6FqN9nmMuRKUGrspfYG9x1gZqcdFyZVgALNwIZj3L7IIhm95MFLRrsB2rIsNsmdSMOqHTjNMZIc0hMxVHwQXC8$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1735340363760000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1A4UVKh-5g5QjByehsUy__\">musictastingclub.com</a></span></font></div><div><img width=\"96\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4zNrrn3oTOOAPoBZRBRqJB4Zr5wvv0edj7ifc3122fcYOZrx7enXKzILiJkS_oI2bh6foix0WU7u1w4\" class=\"CToWUd\" data-bit=\"iit\"></div></div></div>",

With songs pulling elements from dream pop, shoegaze, post-rock, soft rock, and more, this album is \"pleasant\" and \"dreamlike\". It combines psychedelic harpsichord with drum machine beats to create a calming background soundtrack to your life. Favorite songs included Let's Save Tony Orlando's House, Cherry Chapstick, and Our Way to Fall.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Grace's album,<span>&nbsp;</span><b><i>Ill Communication by The Beastie Boys</i></b>, is a light-hearted romp through hip-hop, rap, and punk. Sometimes boys just wanna have fun, too. Some<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>found the shouty vocals and overall rough production style to be a little grating after a while, but standout tracks included Get It Together (with a great feature from Q-Tip), Sabrosa, Futterman's Rule, and of course, the single, Sabotage.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cai's song,<span>&nbsp;</span><b><i>Starburned and Unkissed by Caroline Polachek</i></b>, comes from the soundtrack of the movie I Saw the TV Glow. In theme with the movie, this song explores a longing for a version of yourself that you wish existed, or that no longer exists. Its production, by AG Cook (who, among other things, worked with Charli XCX on Brat), heavily uses autotune and distortion to enhance Polachek's vocals as the song moves through each emotional rise and fall.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Zoey's song,&nbsp;<b><i>Romantic by Mannequin Pussy</i></b><i>,<span>&nbsp;</span></i>is, in contrast to what one might expect based on its title and cover art, an angsty and angry, song, perfect for the approaching early sunsets and freezing weather. This song also comes off of a short, 17-minute album of the same name, so if you liked Romantic and you have a spare 20 minutes (17 for listening and 3 for going through it emotionally post-listen), give it a listen. Or, if you only listen to one other song off Romantic (the album), Zoey recommends<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Emotional High</b>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also,&nbsp;<font color=\"#0000ff\"><b><span class=\"il\">MTC</span><span>&nbsp;</span>watched some music videos</b>,<span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color=\"#000000\">(we didn't get a lot of suggestions and Blurred Lines was vetoed so we watched Gangnam Style).&nbsp;</font></div><div><br></div><div>Once again,</div><div><br></div><div>Hope to see you at&nbsp;<b>5pm&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">in</font><b>&nbsp;Kresge 2420&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">on</font><b>&nbsp;Thursday 10/24</b>&nbsp;ready for discussion!</div><div><br></div><span class=\"gmail_signature_prefix\">--</span><br><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_signature\" data-smartmail=\"gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><b><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"arial black, sans-serif\">Corey Dubin</font></b><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">Print Media Chair |&nbsp;</font><span>Music Tasting Club</span></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!TK66kpnW03KzLmDYeQmqyT7SNYH3mb-6sHAtWkfCYoFLT3wDyshWvFrZAF7yrw8rYKmpGN83ullqV8w3oyQPWcARCcszod7RD2oCh19X4jINaIYbfYGqrIA$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!TK66kpnW03KzLmDYeQmqyT7SNYH3mb-6sHAtWkfCYoFLT3wDyshWvFrZAF7yrw8rYKmpGN83ullqV8w3oyQPWcARCcszod7RD2oCh19X4jINaIYbfYGqrIA$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1735340363754000&amp;usg=AOvVaw04Dm2gZbsroKqCAa8qX6L_\">musictastingclub.com</a></span></font></div><div><img width=\"96\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4zNrrn3oTOOAPoBZRBRqJB4Zr5wvv0edj7ifc3122fcYOZrx7enXKzILiJkS_oI2bh6foix0WU7u1w4\" class=\"CToWUd\" data-bit=\"iit\"></div></div></div>",

It begins with a 2-minute kalimba solo which then fades into a staccato violin section, before dropping into a heavy electric guitar riff. According to Acton, the ideal environment for listening to this album (and all music) is in a closet in the dark. King Crimson weaves contrasting elements together to create what is best described as a soundscape. Favorite elements included the arpeggiation throughout the album, the vocals on Book of Saturday, and the eerie strings.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Aidan's album,<span>&nbsp;</span><b><i>Hadestown (Original Broadway Cast Recording) [2019]‚Äù by Original Broadway Cast of Hadestown</i></b>, is, obviously, the soundtrack to the award-winning Broadway show<span>&nbsp;</span><i>Hadestown</i>. The show is a retelling of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Set in a Depression-era-esque world, Hades is portrayed, not exactly as Satan, as he often is in Greek myth, but as (in Aidan's words) the next closest thing: a capitalist tycoon. While<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>enjoyed the bluesy, New Orleans-style of music, Orpheus' character evoked an extreme reaction of annoyance from some<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">members</span>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Reed's song,&nbsp;<b><i>Overthrown by Thee Oh Sees</i></b>, is a hard rock song that helped Reed channel his emotions last week. Screamy vocals, heavy guitar riffs, and extremely angsty lyrics might be just what you're looking for if you find yourself asking \"what is the point of it all?\".

Waltz #2 (XO), as its name suggests, is a waltzing lament of the singer's family relationships. Smith's melancholy piano and guitar melodies support his raw lyrics that describe an experience at a karaoke bar with his mother and step-father.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Once again,</div><div><br></div><div>Hope to see you (<b><font color=\"#ff9900\">In costume!!</font><font color=\"#000000\">)</font></b>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<b>5pm&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">in</font><b>&nbsp;Kresge 2420&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">on</font><b>&nbsp;Thursday 10/31</b>&nbsp;ready for discussion!</div><div><br></div><span class=\"gmail_signature_prefix\">--</span><br><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_signature\" data-smartmail=\"gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><b><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"arial black, sans-serif\">Corey Dubin</font></b><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">Print Media Chair |&nbsp;</font><span>Music Tasting Club</span></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!RNwlzeR3GKVhjhihvNi77Gxd8Osz6btwmJR6Rt9a3ACyDwnO8dS08Wjpt-4H3eKmNl5PQeEPjd1MCPUR7Ac_3wrcVZcSAzca1QMUXUbjl1m_qiOiAvPlJZc$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!RNwlzeR3GKVhjhihvNi77Gxd8Osz6btwmJR6Rt9a3ACyDwnO8dS08Wjpt-4H3eKmNl5PQeEPjd1MCPUR7Ac_3wrcVZcSAzca1QMUXUbjl1m_qiOiAvPlJZc$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1735340362178000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0UQ7CxW1PI0D0H6Goct_NC\">musictastingclub.com</a></span></font></div><div><img width=\"96\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4zNrrn3oTOOAPoBZRBRqJB4Zr5wvv0edj7ifc3122fcYOZrx7enXKzILiJkS_oI2bh6foix0WU7u1w4\" class=\"CToWUd\" data-bit=\"iit\"></div></div></div>",

Repeating vocal soundbites&nbsp;layer over funky basslines in songs like Live at Dominoes, or over whimsical keyboards in songs like Two Hearts in 3/4 Time (which we determined was not, in fact in&nbsp;3/4 time, and was instead in 6/8).

While this can make the band somewhat polarizing, the club had a generally positive reaction to New Levels New Devils.<span>&nbsp;</span><b>So Strange</b>&nbsp;stands out from the other tracks as the only one with vocals, which also proved polarizing: while Andrew thought the outsourced vocals detracted from the \"virtuoso\" level instrumentation, Simon thought the vocals felt like the necessary result of an instrumental buildup. Some instrumentalists enjoyed the extended \"flex\", others (me) found the perpetual shredding a little immature and musically unearned. Regardless,<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>thought it was an enjoyable listen.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Reed's song,&nbsp;<b><i>Boys At School by SPELLLING</i></b>, is an art-pop song about struggling to fit in with peers in childhood. Echoing and emotion-filled vocals sit atop melancholy synths and guitar melodies. Despite its 7-minute length and&nbsp;slightly repetitive, this song never drags. It continually rises and falls.<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">Members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>thought the lyrics were juvenile but reminiscent, and drew comparisons to Prince and other 80s progressive music.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Simon's song,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>More Than It Hurts You by The Front Bottoms</i>, is the song to put on if you've been angsting out and staring at yourself in the mirror a little too much. The lyrics are, similarly to Boys at School, juvenile in a reminiscent way. Like most midwest emo bands, The Front Bottoms \"can't sing and can't play their guitars\", but this all adds to the raw and honest lyricism. Shout out Simon for the soundtrack to my future breakdowns.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once again,</div><div><br></div><div>See you at&nbsp;<b>5pm&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">in</font><b>&nbsp;Kresge 2420&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">on</font><b>&nbsp;Thursday 11/7</b>&nbsp;ready for discussion!</div><font color=\"#888888\"><br></font><div><br></div><span class=\"gmail_signature_prefix\">--</span><br><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_signature\" data-smartmail=\"gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><b><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"arial black, sans-serif\">Corey Dubin</font></b><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">Print Media Chair |&nbsp;</font><span>Music Tasting Club</span></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!VwMY6ueHndg1Du2bUSfubPrJEH4S-O-yuWG4b1qNj2YZ9o_4fpO0lml56us04dsrU7ZBqSvZLcjIfarQOLmsY5-BXiwB8pes-nkD8CJDFlC6qUtN5tPRSEk$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!VwMY6ueHndg1Du2bUSfubPrJEH4S-O-yuWG4b1qNj2YZ9o_4fpO0lml56us04dsrU7ZBqSvZLcjIfarQOLmsY5-BXiwB8pes-nkD8CJDFlC6qUtN5tPRSEk$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1735340361887000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rpPYwRgMkSf-ZDwMR039Y\">musictastingclub.com</a></span></font></div><div><img width=\"96\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4zNrrn3oTOOAPoBZRBRqJB4Zr5wvv0edj7ifc3122fcYOZrx7enXKzILiJkS_oI2bh6foix0WU7u1w4\" class=\"CToWUd\" data-bit=\"iit\"></div></div></div>",

The first in the trilogy centers around the theme of impending doom, so And in the Darkness, Hearts Aglow, naturally, is about feeling around in the darkness for meaning, specifically in a period of instability and change (topical, no?). Stylistically, this album is similar to Lana del Rey, \"but with actual energy\". Perfect for seasonal depression, this album captures emotions with \"whatever words capture them\". Standout tracks include<span>&nbsp;</span><b>H</b><b>earts Aglow<span>&nbsp;</span></b><span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><b>God Turn Me Into a Flower</b>.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>AJ's album,&nbsp;<i>Stankonia by OutKast</i>, is a chaotic, adventurous, funny album. Though it is a hip-hop album, it's obvious that OutKast didn't listen to hip-hop while recording Stankonia. Instead, the duo listened to mostly Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, and Prince, and the rock influence shows, in the best way. The album also draws from electronic, funk, and more,&nbsp;overall giving the album an \"otherworldly\" quality. The storytelling throughout the album also stands out,&nbsp;particularly on<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Question Mark</b>&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Toilet Tissue</b>. Classics like<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Ms Jackson</b>&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span><b>So Far, So Clean<span>&nbsp;</span></b>also come from Stankonia.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Daniel's song,<span>&nbsp;</span><b><i>How to Disappear Completely&nbsp;by Radiohead</i></b>, is, like<span>&nbsp;</span><i>And in the Darkness, Hearts Aglow</i>, perfect for seasonal&nbsp;depression. If you're looking to cry in the dark on the floor, this might just be your new soundtrack. In the song, Thom Yorke sings about dissociation, depression, and being completely overwhelmed and overstressed. The song begins with a single dissonant tone, and over time builds into a a&nbsp;powerfully pleading climax of strings,&nbsp;vocals, and electronic elements all&nbsp;combined.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My song,&nbsp;<i>I Sat by the Ocean by Queens of the Stone Age</i>, takes lyrics about a tough breakup and lays them over grooving bass and guitar riffs to make a good, simple rock song. Clean guitar slides support the singer's falsetto as he laments what he has lost, producing a satisfying, easy to listen to track with just the right amount of substance.</div><div><br></div><div>Lastly, if you're looking to support some local Northwestern student bands, or see some cheap live music, check out<span>&nbsp;</span><font color=\"#0000ff\">Silver Ring<span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color=\"#000000\">and<span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color=\"#0000ff\">Static Transmission<span>&nbsp;</span></font><font color=\"#000000\">at<span>&nbsp;</span><b>9:15pm</b><span>&nbsp;</span>this<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Friday</b>&nbsp;<b>11/15</b>&nbsp;at<span>&nbsp;</span><b>2019 Ridge Avenue<span>&nbsp;</span></b>(They're really good!)</font></div><div><br></div><div>Once again,</div><div><br></div><div>See you at&nbsp;<b>5pm&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">in</font><b>&nbsp;Kresge 2420&nbsp;</b><font color=\"#000000\">on</font><b>&nbsp;Thursday 11/14</b>&nbsp;ready for discussion!</div><div><br></div><span class=\"gmail_signature_prefix\">--</span><br><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_signature\" data-smartmail=\"gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><b><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"arial black, sans-serif\">Corey Dubin</font></b><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">Print Media Chair |&nbsp;</font><span>Music Tasting Club</span></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!X4iUg9YNsu60ii9Th4JxtJ7UdSx9p-2M48DfF-GAAzUF0vDM34ey7VjJGuHcuD9Nt4aTV0SIvDXJAuWwNpSQTajw_IVKSwh4GTcmCLudHlzRAXjkbpfxb-U$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!X4iUg9YNsu60ii9Th4JxtJ7UdSx9p-2M48DfF-GAAzUF0vDM34ey7VjJGuHcuD9Nt4aTV0SIvDXJAuWwNpSQTajw_IVKSwh4GTcmCLudHlzRAXjkbpfxb-U$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1735340361881000&amp;usg=AOvVaw21CldZmRkxUc_W-gy5Pb5c\">musictastingclub.com</a></span></font></div><div><img width=\"96\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4zNrrn3oTOOAPoBZRBRqJB4Zr5wvv0edj7ifc3122fcYOZrx7enXKzILiJkS_oI2bh6foix0WU7u1w4\" class=\"CToWUd\" data-bit=\"iit\"></div></div></div>",

What they accomplish on this album is nothing less than extraordinary and is a great entry into post-rock if you‚Äôre looking to get into the genre. My fav 3 songs on the album are 1) Nasty 2) Saucy 3) Rich Kids",

Archie first discovered this album from the artwork in the back of a YouTube video, and used his expert searching skills to find the album itself. Released in 2020 during the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, this album features social commentary alongside crazy bars, beautiful instrumentals on tracks like<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Scottie Beam</b>&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span><b>1985</b>, and features from Rick Ross, Tyler, the Creator, Benny the Butcher and Conway the Machine.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Grace's song,<span>&nbsp;</span><b>I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man by Prince<span>&nbsp;</span></b>is an 80s pop song in which Prince plays every single instrument.

Bucket List Project was Saba's debut album, and was written after the death of Saba's uncle. In this album, Saba reflects on his life, his goals, and the world around him. Thoughtful, poetic lyrics on tracks like&nbsp;<b>In Loving Memory</b>&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span><b>American Hypnosis</b>&nbsp;intertwine with lines that introduce some levity to the album on tracks like<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Stoney</b>. Catchy and rhythmic beats form the base of this relaxing and easy-to-listen album. Saba also namedrops familiar features of Chicago, for example, the CTA buses, which gives the album a personal feel for Chicagoans and Chicagoans-by-proxy (suburbs dwellers).&nbsp;</font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\">Isabel's album,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>\"In Case I Make It,\" by&nbsp;Will Wood</i>, follows Bucket List Project well in themes of reflection on one's life and past choices, but with a completely different spin: rather than a chill hip-hop album, \"In Case I Make It,\" is better described as the slightly manic music of an ex theater kid. Reminiscent of artists like Bo Burnham and MGMT, Wood's music pulls elements of musical theater, musical comedy, jazz, and rock together to create his own unique sound. Throughout the album, he reflects on himself, his relationships, and his past substance abuse, all while maintaining a light tone and dreamy melodies. His lyrics are complex, giving the impression that he's \"trying to give you a message, but you're not really sure what it is\", as one club member phrased it. Despite being described as the perfect pairing for a descent into madness, this album was both funny and touching.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\">Daniel's song,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>Do It&nbsp;by Nelly Furtado</i>, is a dance/R&amp;B track with surprisingly controversial production -- Timbaland, one of the producers on the track, allegedly stole the beat from Finnish demoscener Janne Suni. Though Timbaland claimed it was a sample (and not stolen), Suni said he never authorized any commercial sampling of the track. Timbaland commented:</font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\"><br></font></div><div>\"I don't know him from a can of paint. I'm 15 years deep. That's how you attack a king? You attack<span>&nbsp;</span><i>moi</i>?<font color=\"#000000\">\"</font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\">(for more on the Timbaland/Janne Suni beef, see<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland_plagiarism_controversy__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!Rve7DdA60mAbqScJPtiVafA9DO_FvIiKzbfFfJWauxOB3M2mJcLhMW755oJubtaHUhMJmjITLjRvGOWNoWuOTVuFveVyOEHyuBjNA35GiP4FcTyWkunFMng$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland_plagiarism_controversy__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!Rve7DdA60mAbqScJPtiVafA9DO_FvIiKzbfFfJWauxOB3M2mJcLhMW755oJubtaHUhMJmjITLjRvGOWNoWuOTVuFveVyOEHyuBjNA35GiP4FcTyWkunFMng$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1737135731875000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3KRzzb49zJ6QHuk-ljU2LM\">the Wikipedia article</a>)</font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\">Anyway, Do It is a seriously underrated song from the same album that saw Promiscuous and Maneater. Fun, upbeat, and definitely danceable, this is a catchy track, and, though intellectual property theft is very serious, I have to agree with Daniel that it somehow makes this specific track better.</font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\">Finally, Jameson's song<span>&nbsp;</span><i>Cheer by Whitelands</i>&nbsp;is a dreampop/shoegaze track reminiscent of Cocteau Twins and Slowdive. Perfect for the cold weather, this song feels like a haze, like a wall of sound, or like being in a bathtub in the dark. While not a song for every mood, when you need it, Cheer will be there.</font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\">That's all folks!</font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\"><br></font></div><div><font color=\"#000000\">See you at<span>&nbsp;</span></font><b><font color=\"#9900ff\">6pm</font></b><font color=\"#000000\"><span>&nbsp;</span>in<span>&nbsp;</span></font><b><font color=\"#9900ff\">TECH LG52</font></b><font color=\"#000000\"><span>&nbsp;</span>on<span>&nbsp;</span></font><b><font color=\"#9900ff\">Tuesday 1/21</font></b><font color=\"#000000\"><span>&nbsp;</span>ready for discussion!</font></div><span class=\"gmail_signature_prefix\">--</span><br><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_signature\" data-smartmail=\"gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><b><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"arial black, sans-serif\">Corey Dubin</font></b><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">Print Media Chair |&nbsp;</font><span>Music Tasting Club</span></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!Rve7DdA60mAbqScJPtiVafA9DO_FvIiKzbfFfJWauxOB3M2mJcLhMW755oJubtaHUhMJmjITLjRvGOWNoWuOTVuFveVyOEHyuBjNA35GiP4FcTyWhgsMGhQ$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!Rve7DdA60mAbqScJPtiVafA9DO_FvIiKzbfFfJWauxOB3M2mJcLhMW755oJubtaHUhMJmjITLjRvGOWNoWuOTVuFveVyOEHyuBjNA35GiP4FcTyWhgsMGhQ$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1737135731875000&amp;usg=AOvVaw37FGqy5nM8_jxq13s0D6K8\">musictastingclub.com</a></span></font></div><div><img width=\"96\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4zNrrn3oTOOAPoBZRBRqJB4Zr5wvv0edj7ifc3122fcYOZrx7enXKzILiJkS_oI2bh6foix0WU7u1w4\" class=\"CToWUd\" data-bit=\"iit\"></div></div></div>",

Dedicated to Stevens' late partner, this album explores both the romance they once had together and the grief that came after loss. Whimsical guitar melodies layer overtop assorted percussion instruments and underneath lilting vocal harmonies to&nbsp;create a piece of art that falls on your ears like a blanketing of glittering snow on the lakefill. Unfortunately, this 'pretty' quality can lend itself to some of the songs blending into each other, creating more of a soundscape than individually identifiable tracks. The imagery throughout the album is striking, particularly religious elements on tracks like&nbsp;<b>Everything That Rises</b>. Club favourite tracks included<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Shit Talk</b>&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Will Anybody Ever Love Me?</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>AJ listened to their album,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>Sometimes I Might Be Introvert by Little Simz</i>, for the first time not long after they were chosen to pick an album. They loved it immediately, and it's easy to see why. The album opens with a powerful, cinematic, orchestral brass that sounds more like something you might hear in Star Wars than in a hip-hop album. Nevertheless, Little Simz comes in with lyrics that match the energy perfectly. As the album continues, the orchestra draws back, with tracks like<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Little Q Pt 2&nbsp;</b>and<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Rollin Stone</b>&nbsp;approaching a more&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;hip-hop&nbsp;<wbr>style. Some of the lyrics come a little close to \"slam poetry\", but overall this album is innovative, powerful, and, like Javelin, meaningful. In this album, Little Simz reflects on her family, social issues, the music industry, and more. She gets vulnerable while maintaining the sense of awe that is invoked by her creativity and musical skill. Other hard hitting tracks include<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Point and Kill<span>&nbsp;</span></b>and<b>&nbsp;Fear No Man</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Grace's song,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>Helden - German Single Version by David Bowie</i>, threw many club<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"il\">members</span><span>&nbsp;</span>(including me) for loop at first. The guitar riff was eerily familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of David Bowie, even if they had never heard this song before,&nbsp;because Helden is the German&nbsp;version of the uberpopular&nbsp;Heroes. Despite that, listening to Helden is an entirely different experience to listening to Heroes. Bowie's vocals are far more expressive in Helden, is likely a combination of the inherent \"punchiness\" of the German language and Bowie's famous infatuation with Berlin, where he was living when he recorded Heroes. Either way, Helden is definitely worth a listen, even (perhaps especially) if you don't know a word of German.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, Sid's song,&nbsp;<i>Sab√≠a (Stone Flower Version) by Antonio Carlos Jobim</i>, is a bossa nova track that takes many of its lyrics from an 1843 poem about longing to return to Brazil. In the context of the release of the song, this refers instead to returning to a different era of Brazil. Bossa nova, as a genre, arose during a time of prosperity for Brazil, and is defined by its relaxed, carefree sound. Jobim yearns for this era, and so the tranquility of Sab√≠a acts counterrevolutionary to the dictatorship Brazil was under at the time of this song's release. Jobim's sadness is apparent in both his voice and the lazy, almost ominous, brass lines. The woodwinds mimic the sounds of the Sabia, the bird from which this song takes its name. Even if you've never heard of Brazil, this song will make you miss it.</div><div><br></div><div><font color=\"#000000\">Anyway, see you at&nbsp;</font><b><font color=\"#9900ff\">6pm</font></b><font color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;in&nbsp;</font><b><font color=\"#9900ff\">TECH LG52</font></b><font color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;on&nbsp;</font><b><font color=\"#9900ff\">Tuesday 1/28</font></b><font color=\"#000000\">&nbsp;ready for discussion!</font></div><div><br></div><div>Signing off,</div><span class=\"gmail_signature_prefix\">--</span><br><div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"gmail_signature\" data-smartmail=\"gmail_signature\"><div dir=\"ltr\"><b><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"arial black, sans-serif\">Corey Dubin</font></b><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><font color=\"#000000\">Print Media Chair |&nbsp;</font><span>Music Tasting Club</span></font></div><div><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><span><a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!VnNX-r9F2A_p1Kzxum3WrDFyAOHLP4QYusv8xGQc1nle6VxGrOhK0bLoqQOhfcWY1IllbnBazvy7Y7ZhcjxwafaEcLQ-9CSRlufGIVveOTIdB2NKsI7HBRE$\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://musictastingclub.com__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!VnNX-r9F2A_p1Kzxum3WrDFyAOHLP4QYusv8xGQc1nle6VxGrOhK0bLoqQOhfcWY1IllbnBazvy7Y7ZhcjxwafaEcLQ-9CSRlufGIVveOTIdB2NKsI7HBRE$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1738010535756000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3fP6tYeYgNS9b4kILZC9ri\">musictastingclub.com</a></span></font></div><div><img width=\"96\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/mail-sig/AIorK4zNrrn3oTOOAPoBZRBRqJB4Zr5wvv0edj7ifc3122fcYOZrx7enXKzILiJkS_oI2bh6foix0WU7u1w4\" class=\"CToWUd\" data-bit=\"iit\"></div></div></div>",
