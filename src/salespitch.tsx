            <h3>Are you looking for an outlet to gush about your favorite artist or album?</h3>

            Imagine a weekly book club, but instead of books, we listen to albums/songs each week. After one week of listening
            we come back and discuss!
            </p>
            <p>
            Every week, different members of the club choose albums and 
            songs (as of Spring 2024, members pick the Album of the Week, Runner Up Album of the Week, Song of the 
            Week, and Runner Up Song of the Week) and one week later we come back to discuss. What do we discuss? 
            Anything and everything that members thought about the album. From genres to specific instruments to 
            artists to personal significance, everything is on the table for discussion. We'll have debates about 
            different bodies of work, if they're good or bad and why. If we finish early, we play music related 
            activities. For example, we play games like 'guess the blurred out album art' or 'guess the song' trivia.
             Each week we further the discourse about different musical bodies of work and expose people to different 
             songs, EPs, mixtapes, and albums that they may not have otherwise have been aware of. Additionally, we 
             give people the tools to critically analyze the music they listen to. If any of this sounded interesting 
             to you, stop on by! Come with an open mind, and a willingness to share your opinions. Happy listening everybody!</p>
